# Dua

**DUA** (Dual Universal Analysis) is a probabilistic reasoning library in Erlang designed to explore both forward (cause → effect) and backward (effect → cause) inference.

---

## ✨ Motivation

Most probabilistic engines focus either on prediction (from known causes to likely effects) or on retroactive analysis (from observed effects to possible causes). DUA aims to unify both perspectives in a single, flexible system.

We believe that causality in complex systems is **not linear**, and understanding often comes from navigating back and forth between causes and consequences.

## 🔍 What DUA provides

- Bidirectional probabilistic inference (forward + backward)
- Dynamic belief updates based on new observations
- Modular graph-based representation of variables and dependencies
- Declarative API for defining causal relationships
- Clean Erlang interface, with extensibility in mind

---

## 💡 Use cases

- Explainable AI (why did X happen?)
- Fault diagnosis in distributed systems
- Predictive modeling with retroactive updates
- Cognitive models and reasoning engines
- Educational tools for teaching probabilistic logic
